There has been an extensive use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles in search and rescue missions to distribute first aid
kits and food packets. It is important that these UAVs are
able to identify and distinguish the markers from one another for effective distribution. One of the common ways to
mark the locations is via the use of characters superimposed
on shapes of various colors which gives rise to wide variety
of markers based on combination of different shapes, characters, and their respective colors. In this paper, we propose an object detection and classification pipeline which
prevents false positives and minimizes misclassification of
alphanumeric characters and shapes in aerial images. Our
method makes use of traditional computer vision techniques
and unsupervised machine learning methods for identifying
region proposals, segmenting the image targets and removing false positives. We make use of a computationally light
model for classification, making it easy to be deployed on
any aerial vehicle.
